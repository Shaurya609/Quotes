                <p class="card-text">And everyday, I roamed around with this bright cheerful smile. <br>
                    Everyday, I tried to make a difference in someone's life. <br>
                    Everyday, I drowned myself in the commotion of the mind <br>
                    Everyday, I hid my wounds so that I would be their kind. <br>
                    Everyday, I sang songs to tell people that I'm perfectly fine <br>
                    Everyday, I was scared of insanity, I was scared to cross the line, <br>
                    Everyday, I improved and became a much better actor. <br>
                    Everyday, my loud cries could be heard even in Jupiter. <br>
                    But everyday, they went unnoticed. <br>
                    They were pushed aside. <br>
                    I was told that I had to be strong. <br>
                    That I've been good at maintaining the silence since so long. <br>
                    That it's all going to be alright and I just have to hold on. <br>
                    I'm sorry I hid things because everyday when I looked for someone to hold my hand they were gone.
                    <br>
                    So tonight, Hug me close and let me be,<br>
                    Tell me that you'll always be there for me. <br>
                    Don't make promises you can't keep,<br>
                    But just stay the night and let me weep. <br>
                    For tomorrow, will be like everyday,<br>
                    And again, I will have nothing to say.

                    did? <br>
                    Well I may sound mainstream but you still have to go on with your life. <br>
                    No I am not here to inspire you or tell you to build your life , find a hobby , work on you , etc. <br>
                    I'm just asking you to breathe. I'm asking you to stare at the wall with wide open eyes. <br>
                    I'm asking you to go with the flow. Heal yourself the way you want to be healed, you don't always
                    have to go out and own it. <br>
                    Dont make efforts.Let life take you where it wants you to be. <br>
                    Don't get out of that bed, don't stop reading takes of love, don't stop watching romantic movies
                    just because someone left you. <br>
                    Don't stop crying, oh, please never stop crying. <br>
                    Cry your lungs out. Listen to their favourite songs and cry. Wear her t-shirt and then cry. <br>
                    And talk to someone, talk about their beauty of their smile and eyes. <br>
                    Talk about how much they have hurt you and you still want them. Be vulnerable. <br>
                    And one day you will get tired of the monotony. You would want life to be in a certain way, you
                    would want to dress up, eat , drink, dance, smile, laugh , meet new people and just be happy. <br>
                    The pain would last but you will learn to live with it. <br>
                    Yes, that day might come after days or after years but it will surely, will. <br>
                    And in that one day life will fix you , I promise. <br>
                    And I hope that this day I bring to you . <br>
                    Thank you for being a true friend. <br>
                    For sticking by me, for letting me sob into your shoulder, for allowing me to play that same old
                    tiresome record you’ve heard a trillion times before. <br>
                    Thank you for letting me pour my heart out, for listening and for not just telling me what I want to
                    hear. Thank you for loving me when no one else would. <br>
                    Thank you for staying constant in a world full of change and chaos. <br>
                    And thank you for just being there when I need you...it's hard to put it into words just how much
                    you mean to me, because words will never be enough. <br>
                    I know my life wouldn't be the same without you. <br>
                    We have walked so far, laughed so hard, and cried a sea of tears together... <br>
                    We have climbed each other's highest peaks, and travelled through the darkest of valleys... <br>
                    With you by my side the world is a better place. <br>
                    The sun shines a little bit brighter, my smile grows a little bit wider, and in that moment, my
                    problems are no more. <br>
                    You are the most beautiful person, inside and out. <br>
                    You are selfless, compassionate and wise beyond your years. <br>
                    I truly believe I hit friendship gold when you skipped into my life and filled my days with
                    laughter, happy tears and enchantment... <br>
                    You have not only been my rock, my anchor, my tear catching shoulder to cry upon, but you have also
                    taught me many things in life.. <br>
                    You taught me that friends never judge each other no matter what..You taught me to forgive.. <br>
                    Thank you for being my partner-in-crime, my drinking buddy, my road trippin’ companion, my
                    telepathic pal, my personal life coach, my dancing partner and so much more... <br>
                    Thank you for all the glorious memories, wrapped up in a bow of nostalgia, so beautiful it brings a
                    tear to my eye... I promise we will still be the best of friends..!! </p>
