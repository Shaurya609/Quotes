                    In novels you get engrossed by the story,

                    Is it money, fame, respect being greater than the person in frnt of you?
                    If we chase after money we objectify our life, never be happy,
                    No we should chase after happiness, personal satisfaction,
                    If we are happy and satisfied where we are, that's all anyone needs.</p>

                    Paddle too slow you are left behind,

                    Knowing that the other person cares for you,

                <h5 class="card-title">~~~The Paradox Of Life~~</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Being hurt is bad,
                    But without getting hurt we don't get stronger,
                    It gives you wisdom and understanding of how life functions,
                    Helps you tackle problems better,
                    So yes hurt is a necessary evil,
                    And through this I have learnt a lot.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">~~~Beauty Of Bonds~~~</h5>
                <p class="card-text">They say alone is better,
                    That you should look out for yourself only,
                    That bonds hurt and weigh you down,
                    But I believe that bond with the right peron is a beautiful thing,
                    They heal, they make you happy,they give you support.
                    I believe that bonds must be made,
                    Good ones will help you and bad ones will teach you a lesson,
                    Thus bonds are necessary part of life,
                    And those who live without them, haven't lived at all.
                    In the end I quote Harry Potter,
                    "Don't pity the dead, pity the living and those who live without love"</p>

                <p class="card-text">I look for love and comfort in people,
                    I put my hope and expectations,
                    And I give my all to those who I care for,
                    But I end up being hurt again and again,
                    People tend to break expectations,
                    I find myself back again with my books, laptop and music.
                    These are the things that have been always there for me,
                    Comforting me when I fall, making me stand again and keep going forward.
                    Though we shouldn't be materialistic, sometimes materialistic stuff helps.
                    Thus I thank their presence and care for them as I care for a person.
                    More than things, they have turned into my best friends and support.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Humans want teleportation,
                    To get from one place to another as fast they can.
                    But I think travelling is beautiful,
                    It gives you peace and time to think,
                    I think the almighty made travel so that we rest a little,
                    We take time off and be in the flow of the space-time continium itself.
                    That is why we always say,
                    "It is not about the destination, but about the journey".</p>
