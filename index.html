                    In novels you get engrossed by the story,<br>
                    Forgetting all your problems, pain and anxiety,<br>

                    Is it money, fame, respect being greater than the person in front of you?<br>
                    If we chase after money we objectify our life, never be happy,<br>
                    No we should chase after happiness, personal satisfaction,<br>
                    If we are happy and satisfied where we are, that's all anyone needs.</p>

                    Do I not fear Death?<br>
                    I have heard fear drives you,<br>
                    Fear is your greatest strength,<br>
                    So does that mean I lost my drive?<br>

                <h5 class="card-title">~~~The Paradox Of Life~~</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Being hurt is bad,<br>
                    But without getting hurt we don't get stronger,<br>
                    It gives you wisdom and understanding of how life functions,<br>
                    Helps you tackle problems better,<br>
                    So yes hurt is a necessary evil,<br>
                    And through this I have learnt a lot.</p>

                <p class="card-text">They say alone is better,<br>
                    That you should look out for yourself only,<br>
                    That bonds hurt and weigh you down,<br>
                    But I believe that bond with the right peron is a beautiful thing,<br>
                    They heal, they make you happy,they give you support.<br>
                    I believe that bonds must be made,<br>
                    Good ones will help you and bad ones will teach you a lesson,<br>
                    Thus bonds are necessary part of life,<br>
                    And those who live without them, haven't lived at all.<br>
                    In the end I quote Harry Potter,<br>
                    "Don't pity the dead, pity the living and those who live without love"</p>

                <p class="card-text">I look for love and comfort in people,<br>
                    I put my hope and expectations,<br>
                    And I give my all to those who I care for,<br>
                    But I end up being hurt again and again,<br>
                    People tend to break expectations,<br>
                    I find myself back again with my books, laptop and music.<br>
                    These are the things that have been always there for me,<br>
                    Comforting me when I fall, making me stand again and keep going forward.<br>
                    Though we shouldn't be materialistic, sometimes materialistic stuff helps.<br>
                    Thus I thank their presence and care for them as I care for a person.<br>
                    More than things, they have turned into my best friends and support.</p>

                    To get from one place to another as fast they can.<br>
                    But I think travelling is beautiful,<br>
                    It gives you peace and time to think,<br>
                    I think the almighty made travel so that we rest a little,<br>
                    We take time off and be in the flow of the space-time continium itself.<br>
                    That is why we always say,<br>
