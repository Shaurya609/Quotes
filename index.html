                    We stopped looking for monsters under our bed when we realised they are within us.<br>
                    Often taken lightly and pushed aside for too long, they can take over.<br>
                    I am not talking about mythical demons I am talking about demons like Anger, Lust, Pain, Thirst for
                    revenge etc.<br>
                    If they are not quelled you may as well burst like a baloon being overinflated.<br>
                    For me they are two demons Anger and Lust. Far too long I have been keeping them inside. Far too
                    long.<br>
                    And now they are rearing to get out and I am afraid one day they will take control.<br>
                    I don't want to harm anyone or do anything wrong.<br>
                    So I search for methods to get them out I search myself, I search others.<br>
                    Till now I have been searching alone, but now I have my best friend.<br>
                    We both will search together and defeat these demons, I have to be both cooperative and patient.<br>
                    These demons will resist the efforts made by me and my best friend. But we will overcome.<br>
                    Some time, some day I will be free of them. And unto this hope I hold.<br>

                    I care a lot about many people, But somehow down the line I end up pushed aside,<br>

                    I say I understand and I do,<br>
                    But it tears me up from inside,<br>
                    Trying to keep smiling and caring,
                    They say one day you will find that person,<br>
                    Who cares unconditionally,
                    And many times I have thought I have found the one,<br>
                    But they have their own problems of who I care for first,<br>
                    Is that a flaw? Something wrong with me?<br>
                    In this rat race I wish to see who I care for happy,
                    And in return I want care nothing else,<br>
                    People share their memories,
                    Listening to them I want to make some of my own,<br>
                    I go to those who I am close to,
                    But again I tend to get pushed aside for reasons.<br>
                    Am I that insignificant? That ignorable?<br>
                    Maybe yes because my care has always landed me in this position.

                <p class="card-text">They say alone is better,<br>
                    That you should look out for yourself only,<br>
                    That bonds hurt and weigh you down,<br>
                    But I believe that bond with the right peron is a beautiful thing,<br>
                    They heal, they make you happy,they give you support.<br>
                    I believe that bonds must be made,<br>
                    Good ones will help you and bad ones will teach you a lesson,<br>
                    Thus bonds are necessary part of life,<br>
                    And those who live without them, haven't lived at all.<br>
                    In the end I quote Harry Potter,<br>
                    "Don't pity the dead, pity the living and those who live without love"</p>

                <p class="card-text">I look for love and comfort in people,<br>
                    I put my hope and expectations,<br>
                    And I give my all to those who I care for,<br>
                    But I end up being hurt again and again,<br>
                    People tend to break expectations,<br>
                    I find myself back again with my books, laptop and music.<br>
                    These are the things that have been always there for me,<br>
                    Comforting me when I fall, making me stand again and keep going forward.<br>
                    Though we shouldn't be materialistic, sometimes materialistic stuff helps.<br>
                    Thus I thank their presence and care for them as I care for a person.<br>
                    More than things, they have turned into my best friends and support.</p>

                    Thinking is perceived as a train of thought,<br>
                    A straight path to a goal,<br>
                    Overthinking on the other hand is like white water rafting,<br>
                    So much chaos, so much confusion, paddle wrong and you sink,<br>
                    The only way to get out is focus on a point and paddle straight.

                   I have come to a point in life where I feel it is easier to let go of people rather than trust them,<br>
                   I have had my heart broker and trust betrayed, people who I held dear, abandon me,<br>
                   I have had too much of a bad experience with people, I only trust a few,<br>
                   I have trouble talking to new people, I think twice before trusting them,<br>
                   Because as they say, wounds heal, scars don't.
